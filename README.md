my audio visual (AV) patches and code for fakedac~ 000-003

## basic plan

```sh

Pure data (Pd) patch handles audio & talks to a processing sketch for visuals over OSC (open sound control).

The processing sketch can play videos and select images from a folder in time to musical or tempo events from Pd

The video's and photo's  can be procedurally generated and re-processed with various tools.

Audio visual and parameterization can be linked directly to machine listening from Pd using objects like: bonk~, sigmund~, timbre features.

```
